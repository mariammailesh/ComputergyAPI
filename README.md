## 🗺️ Codebase Map (Project Structure)

This project follows a structured approach to organize code logically. Here's a simplified overview of the key directories based on the Solution Explorer:

```
*Note: Some file names like `IAuthanication.cs`, `AuthanicationService.cs`, `IProducts.cs`, `ProductsService.cs` might contain typos in the original source and are listed as seen in the screenshot, but the likely intended names are Authentication and Product/Products Service.*

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later
*   A database server (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
*   A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Computergy.API
    ```
3.  Restore dependencies:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Update the database connection string and other application settings in `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.{EnvironmentName}.json`.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Your_Database_Connection_String_Here"
  },
  // Other settings like JWT configuration, external service keys, etc.
}
```
**Important:** Do not commit sensitive credentials to version control. Use environment variables or secret management tools.

## 💾 Database Setup

This project uses Entity Framework Core Migrations. To set up your database:

1.  Ensure your connection string in `appsettings.json` is correct.
2.  Apply the migrations to create the database schema:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

## ▶️ Running the API

You can run the API from the project directory:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will typically start on `https://localhost:5001` and `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## 📚 API Documentation (Swagger)

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI. Once the application is running, navigate to:

[https://localhost:5001/swagger](https://localhost:5001/swagger) (Adjust host and port if necessary)

This interface allows you to explore the available endpoints, understand request/response models, and test API calls directly from your browser.
